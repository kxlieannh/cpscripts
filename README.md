Current Comments:

winaudit.ps1 - Running into issues running/testing the script, review script.

review issue: Script failed giving a error from line 1 with the "@echo off"

That was the only error I got from that script but it states that the "off" is a unexpected token 
while with the "@echo" it says that "@" cant be used to represent a variable and also "@echo" can only be used as an argument to a command.
Ill look into it more but thats the only issues im having trouble with -MG

windef.ps1 - Successfully tested/ran script. No issues.

winpass.ps1 - Successfully tested/ran script. No issues.
